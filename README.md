# Real-Time Simulation Models for Photovoltaic Cells and Arrays in Opal-RT and Typhoon-HIL
<img src="https://github.com/ALSETLab/pvmodel2020/blob/master/ALSET_PV_models/pic/pic.png" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/ALSETLab/pvmodel2020/blob/master/ALSET_PV_models/pic/pic.png" width="280" height="240" />

This repository contains the models from the paper:
> Xinlan Jia, Prottay M. Adhikari, and Luigi Vanfretti "Real-Time Simulation Models for Photovoltaic Cells and Arrays in Opal-RT and Typhoon-HIL," In Proceedings of the 2020 IEEE PES General Meeting, August 2-6, 2020.

See the full paper for documentation on the models under the `./doc` folder.

Under the `./source` directory, you will find the "plain" Matlab/Simulink model. Two subfolders for the Opal-RT and the Typhoon HIL simulator includes the real-time simulation models for each corresponding target.


## Development, Maintenance and Contribution
These models were implemented and compiled by Xinlan Jia in ALSET Lab, RPI.

Some testing was done by Prottay M. Adhikari.

The work was completed under the supervision of [Luigi Vanfretti](https://github.com/lvanfretti), who administers this repository.

Contributions are welcome via pull requests.
